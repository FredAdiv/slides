## Companies using Docker in Israel
{id: docker-in-israel}

{aside}
I know that most of the readers of these slides are from around the world, but I run most of my courses in Israel,
so I have special interest in knowing which companies are using docker and what job titles do the people who use it have.
At one point I might create similar pages for some other countries as well.

## Docker history
{id: docker-history}

{aside}
Each Docker image is built by layers upon layers.

The `docker history` command can show you these layers.
{/aside}

```
docker history IMAGE
```

{aside}
Here you can see that the Ubuntu image we have downloaded from the Docker Hub has 5 layers.
{/aside}

```
$ docker history ubuntu:20.04
```

![](examples/dock/history_ubuntu.out)


## Docker history - multiple layers
{id: docker-history-multiple-layers}

{aside}
If you run the same command on the mydocker image we have just created you can see that it has 2 more layers.
Each **RUN** command created a layer.

Layers are created separately so having multiple layers makes our development process faster.
However having many layers is not recommended so once in a while we usually merge the RUN instructions together
and rebuild the image to have less layers. We'll talk about this later.
{/aside}

```
docker history mydocker
```

![](examples/dock/history_mydocker.out)
