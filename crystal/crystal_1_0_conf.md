## Slides for training course
{id: crystal-1-0-conf-slides}

Prepare slides for a training course - lots of small examples, questions arise, make me learn more

Developing an application - The site listing the shards are very plain, only a thin wrapper around GitHub API
 Let's do a much better one analyzing shards and displaying information

## Shards install dependency issues
{id: crystal-1-0-conf-shards-install-issues}

`shards install`

Failed to resolve dependencies, try updating incompatible shards or use --ignore-crystal-version as a workaround if no update is available.


What are these ? and ! mean at the end of the functions and sometimes end of various statements?
What does   !something.empty? and why don't you write Â¡empty! anyway? That would at least make sense...

## GitHub Actions
{id: crystal-1-0-conf-github-actions}

[GitHub Actions configurator](https://crystal-lang.github.io/install-crystal/configurator.html)


The need to recompile the whole thing before I run it and the fact that compilation is slow makes life of a (web) developer hard.
The Jinja Template system of Johannes that does not need to be compiled makes at least the HTML development much faster.


## Future
{id: crystal-1-0-conf-future}

* Crystal Weekly?
* Crystal course
* Crystal book (based on the course?)

   https://www.pragprog.com/titles/crystal/programming-crystal/

A lack of consitency of that ? and ! mean and when they are needed (delete vs reject and reject!)
